<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing the M.S. degree at the [Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia](https://www.inm.ntu.edu.tw/), [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), Taipei City, Taiwan. 
I am now a member of [NTU imLab](https://ntuimlab.tw/), and advised by Prof. [Yi-Ping Hung](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hung/index.html#about).

I received my B.S. degree in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ee.tku.edu.tw/) from [Tamkang University](https://www.tku.edu.tw/), New Taipei City, Taiwan, in 2023. 
From 2020 to 2023, I conducted research in the Advanced Mixed-Operation System Laboratory (AMOS Lab.) at Tamkang University, focusing on deep learning and computer vision under the supervision of Prof. [Jen-Shiun Chiang](https://www.ee.tku.edu.tw/member-detail/102/).

My primary research areas include Deep Learning (DL), Neural Networks (NN), Computer Vision (CV), and Image Processing (IP). In addition, I have contributed to some projects in other fields, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Speech & Audio. I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r8F35p8AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fruiyangju%2Fruiyangju.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the international journal or conferences such as KBS, ICONIP, PRICAI.

Further details about my background can be found in my resume (available in both 
<a href='https://ruiyangju.github.io/images/CV_English.pdf'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Resume-English-white?color=green'></a> and <a href='https://ruiyangju.github.io/images/CV_Chinese.pdf'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Resume-Chinese-white?color=blue'></a>).
